#### Some exercises

- What is stumper1.c supposed to do? Debug stumper1.c and make it work.

#### C Programming exercises.

- Run the "hello, world" program on your system. Experiment with leaving out parts of the program,to see what error messages you get. pg7.
- Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading above the table. pg12.

> For each of these below this point, write a couple unit tests using https://libcheck.github.io/check/

- Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table. 
- Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging
- Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters in its input.
- Rewrite the temperature conversion program above to use a function for conversion.
- Write a program to "fold" long input lines into two or more shorter lines after the last non-blank character that occurs before the n-th column of input. Make sure your program does something intelligent with very long lines, and if there are no blanks or tabs before the specified column.
- Write a program to remove all comments from a C program. Don't forget to handle quoted strings and character constants properly. C com- ments do not nest.

- Write a function `reverse(s)` that reverses the character strings. Use it to write a program that reverses its input a line at a time.
- a Makefile that can compile all of these exercises.
